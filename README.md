# Framework for career progression

This repository has the details about YLD's framework for career progression. It
describes the rationale behind the framework, its benefits, and lists the
positions together with their descriptions.

## How to read it

The best way to familiarise yourself with it is by reading the following
documents first:

- [Introduction][Intro.md];
- [Benefits][Benefits.md];
- [Role descriptions][Roles.md];
- [FAQs][FAQs.md].

## Credits

Even though this framework was built internally with YLD in mind, we had
inspiration from a number of sources and we would like to give credit to a few:

- Basecamp's company [handbook][1];
- Spotify's [framework][2];
- Rent The Runway's [ladder][3] by Camille Fournier;
- Several other books, articles and resources we found online.

We have then worked together to build something that works for us.

## Contribute
