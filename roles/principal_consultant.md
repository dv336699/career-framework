# Principal consultant

Principal consultants are responsible for up to three clients. They’re the last word on the success of a project and act as the point of contact for the wider YLD team and the client senior staff. They help build the team, assist with pre-sales, keep relationships healthy and look for further opportunities within existing clients.

Below are some guidelines of what we’d like to see in our principal consultants.
