# Principal Consultant

A Principal Consultant is responsible for up to 3 clients. They are the
responsible for the success at a client and are the point of contact for
both YLD and the senior staff at the client. They help build the team,
help with pre-sales, keep the relationships healthy and look for further
opportunities within their clients.
