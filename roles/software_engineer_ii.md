# Software Engineer II

At this level, Software engineers are self-sufficient, proactive and experienced. They’re solid contributors with independence; producing quality output and helping our less experienced engineers. They’re expected to take part in architectural conversations and to be able to articulate their ideas with confidence.

Below are some guidelines of what we’d like to see in our level two software engineers.
