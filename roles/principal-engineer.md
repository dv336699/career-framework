# Principal Engineer

A Principal Engineer is highly experienced and an expert in some of the technologies we use at YLD. They are invaluable when solving complex problems both with our clients and with our own products. They are responsible for
guiding and leading our efforts in the field in multiple clients, and act as a reference for the wider YLD team. They assist with pre-sales, keep relationships healthy, and look for further opportunities within existing clients.

Below are some guidelines of what we’d like to see in our Principal Engineers.
