# Contributing

Please help us make the career framework better. If you would like to contribute
to it, please open an issue or a Pull Request.

You're welcome to suggest bigger changes as well. We will discuss those in the
context of our internal teams, client needs and the financial model that
supports it, in order to validate the changes.

Although we intend to provide stability to the framework, we will continuously
review it and make changes that better reflect the needs of everybody involved.
